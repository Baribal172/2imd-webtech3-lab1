        <p>It would be a fairly simple project, the game would be in a style very reminiscent of the early internet (circa 2001-2004)</p>
        <p>To be perfectly blunt we don't really know what to do with the actual app itself or anything, we just think it
            would be rather cool to have such an old school type game in 2d on an online platform as it would provide quite a fun
            challenge for us in a variety of ways.
